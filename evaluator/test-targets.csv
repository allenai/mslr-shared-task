0,205832151,"Current evidence from systematic review and meta- analysis revealed that  probiotics  are the most promising intervention in reduction of the incidence of  NEC  in  VLBW neonates .
 As per the evidence ,  prebiotics  modulate the composition of human intestine microflora to the benefit of the host by  suppression  of  colonization of harmful microorganism  and /or  the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth , decreased stool viscosity , reduced gastrointestinal transit time , and better feed tolerance .","<background> Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is one of the most serious gastrointestinal emergencies in <pop> very low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm neonates </pop> , affecting 7 - 14 % of these neonates .
Due to the seriousness of the disease , prevention of NEC is the most important goal . </background>"
1,1785126,"The use of glucomannan did not appear to significantly alter any other study  endpoints  .
 Pediatric patients  ,  patients receiving dietary modification  , and  patients with impaired glucose metabolism  did not benefit from  glucomannan  to the same degree .
CONCLUSIONS  Glucomannan  appears to beneficially affect  total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , body weight , and FBG  , but not HDL cholesterol or BP","<background> BACKGROUND Several clinical trials have investigated the impact of <int> glucomannan </int> on <out> plasma lipids , body weight , fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) , and blood pressure ( BP ) </out> , but have yielded conflicting results and had only modest sample sizes .
OBJECTIVE The objective was to perform a meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials of <int> glucomannan </int> to better characterize its impact on <out> plasma lipids , FBG , body weight , and BP . </background>"
2,35828882,Ensuring that the characteristics of the history and future ascents are similar may improve the clinical utility of AMS history,<background> PURPOSE The goal of this meta- analysis was to determine the clinical utility of <int> <pop> acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) </int> history </pop> to predict future incidents of AMS . </background>
3,218494863," The QT autograft detected comparable rate of Lachman test > 3 mm  ,  Pivot shift test >  3 m and  instrumental laxity  > 3 mm .
The QT  autograft  showed a  lower rate of autograft failure  above all .
The QT  autograft  detected the  reduced rate of AKP  than the PT  .
 Quadriceps tendon autograft may represent a feasible option for primary ACL reconstruction .","<background> The purpose of the current study was to clarify the role of the <int> quadriceps tendon ( QT ) autograft </int> for primary ACL reconstruction .
Thus , a Bayesian network meta- analysis comparing <pop> patients undergoing a <int> primary ACL reconstruction with QT versus patellar tendon ( PT ) and hamstring tendon ( HT ) autografts </int> </pop> was conducted . </background>"
