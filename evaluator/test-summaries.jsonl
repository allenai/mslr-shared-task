SETTING <pop> RACFs in Sydney , Australia . </pop> PARTICIPANTS <pop> Study participants ( N=602 ; 70.9 % female ) were recruited from 51 RACFs . Mean age was 85.7 \u00b1 6.4 , and mean DBI was 0.60 \u00b1 0.66 . </pop> MEASUREMENTS Medication history was obtained on each <pop> participant . </pop> Drugs were classified as <int> anticholinergic or sedative </int> and a DBI was calculated <out> . Falls </out> were measured over a 12-month <out> period . Comorbidity , cognitive impairment ( Mini-Mental State Examination ) and depression ( Geriatric Depression Scale ) </out> were determined . RESULTS There were <pop> 998 <out> falls </out> in 330 individuals </pop> during a follow-up period of 574.2 person-years , equating to an average rate of 1.74 falls per person-year . The univariate negative binomial regression model <out> for falls showed incidence rate ratios </out> of 1.69 ( 95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.22 - 2.34 ) for low DBI ( < 1 ) and 2.11 ( 95 % CI=1.47 - 3.04 ) for high DBI ( \u22651 ) when compared with those who had a DBI of 0 . After adjusting for <out> age </out> , <out> sex , history of falling , cognitive impairment , depression , use of a walking aid , comorbidities , polypharmacy , and incontinence , incident rate ratios </out> of 1.61 ( 95 % CI=1.17 - 2.23 ) for low DBI and 1.90 ( 95 % CI=1.30 - 2.78 ) for high DBI were obtained . CONCLUSION DBI is significantly and independently associated <out> with <pop> falls </out> in older people living in RACFs . </pop> Interventional studies design ed for this population are needed to determine whether reducing DBI , through dose reduction or cessation <int> of anticholinergic and sedative drugs </int> , can <out> prevent falls </out> </ref>", "full_text": null, "s2id": 28567494, "s2hash": "5219535e0e955bee8fb326062e2c63b9d1650b53"}, {"title_abstract": "<ref> Changes in cognitive functioning with risperidone and olanzapine treatment: a large-scale, double-blind, randomized study <sep> Objective The effects of <int> risperidone </int> and <int> olanzapine </int> on <out> cognitive functioning </out> in <pop> patients with schizophrenia </pop> were compared in a r and omized , double-blind trial . Method <pop> Three hundred and seventy-seven patients </pop> were <pop> r and omly </pop> assigned to receive 2\u20136 mg/day of <int> risperidone </int> or 5\u201320 mg/day of <int> olanzapine </int> for 8 weeks . Cognitive function was assessed with a focused cognitive assessment battery ; in addition , extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale ( ESRS ) , and the positive and negative syndrome scale ( PANSS ) was rated for all patients . Results Treatment with these two atypical antipsychotic medications was associated with improved performance on the <out> Wisconsin card sorting test , the trail-making test , the California verbal learning test , the continuous performance test , and some aspects of verbal fluency and spatial working memory . </out> No differences in the effects of the drugs on any of the cognitive tests were noted . Correcting for the effects of anticholinergic treatment did not alter the magnitude of cognitive effects .

Previous reports of greater benefits of <int> olanzapine </int> over risperidone in a small- sample pilot study were not substantiated .
